# Plant
A project for keeping track of the ambient temperature, humidity and pressure to help provide ideal plant coniditons.
This project integrates Blynk, ThingSpeak and a raspberry Pi connected up to a Sense Hat to monitor environmental data (temperature, humidity, pressure). This data is sent to ThingSpeak for logging and to Blynk for real-time monitoring and control via a mobile app. An alert system is set up to send an email alert to the user when any of these values go outside the ideal range (This range would need to be modified depending on the specific plant and its specific needs).
